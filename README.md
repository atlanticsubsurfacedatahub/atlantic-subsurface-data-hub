# Atlantic Subsurface Data Hub – Spectacular (static) site

This is a static, single‑page site (HTML/CSS/JS) designed for GitHub Pages.

## What’s new in this version
- **Hero video background** (local file: `assets/hero.mp4`) with poster fallback
- **Case study** section (before → after → impact)
- **Real subsurface screenshots** (open‑license examples) with **redaction/blur strips**

## Upload to GitHub (no installs)
1. Open your repo on GitHub
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**
3. Drag‑drop **everything from this zip** into the repo root:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `assets/` folder (important)

Commit → GitHub Pages redeploys automatically.

## Swap the hero video (optional)
Replace `assets/hero.mp4` with your own looped MP4 (recommended: 6–12 seconds, muted, 720p or 1080p).
The page will still look good even if the video fails to load (it uses the poster + gradients).

## Visual credits (built‑in)
- USGS / federal public‑domain imagery (via Wikimedia and USGS sources)
- Wikimedia Commons well‑log examples (open licenses)
- Unsplash geology textures (Unsplash License)

If you want, I can also remove all external images and make the site 100% self‑contained.
